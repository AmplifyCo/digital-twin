Nova is a self-hosted, single-user AI assistant you run on your own server. It connects to you via Telegram, learns your preferences over time, and can take actions — send emails, post to X, manage your calendar, set reminders, browse the web, and more.

Unlike generic chatbots, Nova builds a memory of who you are. It remembers your communication style, preferences, and past conversations to provide increasingly personalized assistance.

## What Nova Can Do

- **Conversations** — Chat naturally via Telegram with context from past interactions
- **Email** — Read, compose, and reply to emails on your behalf
- **Calendar** — Check, create, and manage calendar events
- **Social Media** — Post to X (Twitter), including community posts
- **Reminders** — Set time-based reminders that fire via Telegram notifications
- **Web Browsing** — Browse pages with visual verification (screenshots)
- **Web Research** — Fetch and summarize web content
- **File Operations** — Read, write, and manage files
- **Shell Commands** — Execute scripts and terminal commands
- **Memory** — Learns and recalls your preferences, habits, and context

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An LLM API key — Nova supports multiple providers (see Configuration)
- Telegram Bot Token ([create one via BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmplifyCo/project-nova.git
cd project-nova

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env` with your credentials. Nova works with any of the supported LLM providers — configure whichever you have access to:

```bash
# LLM Provider — configure one or more
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key        # Claude (claude-sonnet, claude-haiku, ...)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key              # Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-pro, ...)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key              # OpenAI-compatible endpoints

# Telegram (required)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id

# Optional — enable talents as needed
EMAIL_ADDRESS=you@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com

CALDAV_URL=your_caldav_url
CALDAV_USERNAME=your_username
CALDAV_PASSWORD=your_password

X_API_KEY=your_x_api_key
X_API_SECRET=your_x_api_secret
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_x_access_token
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_x_access_token_secret
```

Nova routes tasks to the best available model automatically — fast models for quick responses, smarter models for complex reasoning — and falls back gracefully when a provider is unavailable.

### Run

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Nova starts and connects to Telegram. Message your bot to begin.

## Deployment (Amazon Linux / EC2)

```bash
# SSH into your instance
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip

# Clone, install, configure
git clone https://github.com/AmplifyCo/project-nova.git
cd project-nova
chmod +x deploy/ec2/setup.sh
./deploy/ec2/setup.sh

# Configure
nano .env

# Run as a service
sudo systemctl start digital-twin
sudo systemctl enable digital-twin
```

### Optional: Browser Support

For full web browsing with visual verification:

```bash
sudo yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
pip install playwright
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

---

## Adding Talents

Nova's capabilities are modular. Each talent can be enabled independently by adding the required credentials to `.env`. See `config/talents.yaml` for the full list of available and upcoming talents.

```bash
# Check talent status
python -m src.setup talents
```

---

## Architecture

Nova is framework-free — pure Python and asyncio with no heavyweight orchestration frameworks. It is built around three layers:

- **Heart** — the conversation manager that routes intent, selects the right model tier, and dispatches tool calls
- **Brain** — a set of intelligence principles that govern how Nova thinks and acts (plan before acting, verify before done, minimal impact, etc.)
- **Memory** — a vector-backed store of your conversations, preferences, and context, used to personalize every response

Background services handle self-monitoring (error detection + auto-fix), scheduled reminders, and periodic memory consolidation.

### Multi-LLM Routing

Nova supports multiple LLM providers through a unified model router. Tasks are matched to models based on latency, capability, and cost requirements:

| Task type | Default model tier |
|---|---|
| Fast replies, intent classification | Flash / Haiku class |
| Tool use, reasoning, code | Sonnet class |
| Complex research, synthesis | Opus / Pro class |

Configure your preferred providers in `.env`; Nova uses what's available.

## Security

- Single-user by design — only your Telegram chat ID can interact
- Credentials stored in `.env`, never committed
- Tool execution is governed by risk-based policies
- Side effects (emails, posts) are deduplicated to prevent double-sends
- All tool outputs are treated as untrusted data

## Disclaimer

Nova is an autonomous AI assistant with real-world capabilities (sending emails, posting to social media, executing commands). Always review its configuration and monitor its behavior, especially when first deploying.
